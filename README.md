# processingjs_ide

This is a rewrite of the sketch.processing.org ide using ajax.org's Ace editor instead of the now defunct Bespin editor.

The editor_wrapper.js file wraps the functionality of the ace editor, so presumably it will be easy to swap out editors later if necessary.

It's MIT Licensed, so feel free to use it for whatever.
